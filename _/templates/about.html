	<p>Halloween 2009. Meaghan was asked to go to a party with her friends, Erin and Chris. This being her favorite holiday, she took this party seriously and was doned in costume from head to toe as Lara Croft Tomb Raider. Although most of the people at the party were from her home town, they were a year older and she didn’t really know anyone. After a few drinks she got to chatting with people and eventually came upon the Monopoly Man, aka Don. They talked for a while and even took a picture together.</p>

	<p>The next day Erin told Meg that Don wanted her number. Knowing he lived and worked in New Jersey and she lived and worked on Long Island, Meaghan decided not to give out her number. Over the next two years their groups of friends merged and they saw each other all the time. Don didn’t keep his feelings for Meaghan quiet and continued to ask her to hang out. When he had parties at his apartment in New Jersey  Meaghan would say ‘I’ll try to get there,’ (girl code for I’m not going to make it). Meaghan later found out that Don doesn’t know girl code, and every party he waited for her to arrive and was heartbroken when she didn’t show.</p>

	<p>Fast forward to December 2011, Santacon. In true Bishroches fashion, both wearing costumes.  After many drinks, something about Don’s teddy bear sweatshirt and red leggings changed Meaghan's mind. During karaoke Don and Meg had their first kiss, at which point every person in the room stopped and stared at them knowing that Don had been in love with her for the past 2 years to no avail. The next day Meg was still unsure what to do, not wanting to ruin their friendship. Don on the other hand was on cloud 9. After many texts back and forth and a coaxed ‘first date’ at Party City, Don and Meg began dating and the rest is history.</p>

	<p>Anyone who knew Meaghan knew that she was never quiet when it came to getting engaged. And just like perfect opposites, anyone who knew Don knew he wanted anything but to get engaged. So how did this wind up happening? What lead up to the events that took place that early Sunday morning in December?</p>

    <p>It was a brisk Friday night in November and Don was on his way to meet Meaghan at the movies. He had known for a while that he was going to ask Meaghan to marry him but was avoiding the topic every chance he got, so that when the time did come she would be more surprised then ever. On his way,he decided to call his Aunt Diane to get her friend Wayne's number. Wayne was a jeweler and since Don knew absolutely nothing when it came to jewelry, he wanted to make sure he was in good hands. Diane took the call like a champ. Played it cool, and didn't lead on to knowing what Don was about to do. She calmly gave him the phone number and wished him a good night. Later it was revealed that she burst out into a screaming fit when she hung up the phone, because no one plays a fast one on Aunt Diane and she knew everything that was about to happen.</p>

    <p>The following week was Thanksgiving. Don decided to take the few days before the holiday as he had some extra vacation days, or so Meg thought. Don played it cool and scheduled a lunch date for the Tuesday he would be home. He told Meg that he would meet her by her job in the city because he didn't have anything going on and thought it would be a nice break in the day for her. Little did she know, Don had called Wayne and had scheduled an appointment for 10am that same morning. Wayne's store opens at 11am but since Don was his good friend's nephew he decided to open a little early so that he could dedicate his attention to helping Don as best he could.</p>

    <p>Prior to arriving at the store Don had done his homework. He brought pictures of things he knew that Meg liked, and had even gone as far as to try on all of her rings to make sure the size was perfect. He felt so prepared, but also very nervous. Wayne being extremely helpful, decided to ask Don all sorts of questions to which he only knew a few of the answers. After the questioning Wayne then decided to take out the biggest book of engagement rings that Don had ever seen in his life. Don now began to sweat. He realized that he knew nothing. Nothing could have prepared him to pick out this engagement ring. Fortunately he had some pictures with him. He decided to show Wayne the pictures he had brought. To make things a little harder, Meg had said that she liked a ring of almost every style, so there was little to go off of from these pictures. They were all so different. "You can pretty much chose any ring you like", said Wayne after seeing the pictures. Don now had the task of flipping though what seemed to be a 100,000 page book of rings, each page containing 20 rings. Don made up his mind, thanked Wayne, and semi-confidently walked out, thinking he had done a good job.</p>

    <p>As Don raced home to make it to lunch on time, he'd wished that he had made the lunch appointment with Meg a little later. When he arrived at Meg's job he knew he had to play it cool. Luckily for him he had recently purchased GTA V, a video game that was consuming a lot of his time. "I'm happy we decided to go to lunch today or I probably wouldn't have left the couch at all.", he said to her before biting into his burger. That should cover his steps enough, he thought.</p>

    <p>A few weeks later, Don had already received the ring and he thought it came out great. It was finally the weekend he was proposing so he would only have to keep his secret for a few more days. Meg and Don were to meet their friend, Jess for her birthday and see the final Hobbit movie. Upon arriving at the theater he received a text from his good friend Olive. The text read "Uh oh bro". "What did that mean?", he thought. He inquired as to what was meant by the previously vague text and found out that his good friends Stoecker and Andrea had gotten engaged only minutes before. None of Don's friends knew his plans, because his main goal was a surprise and he didn't want to risk anything, but he knew that Meg wouldn't take this lightly. Don thanked Olive for the heads up, now knowing he needed to prepare for the fury that Meg was about to bring.</p>

    <p>The next day was Meg and Don's annual friend's gift exchange and they were to be surrounded by lots of friends. Don thought that there would be safety in numbers, so all he had to do was get through the night. Everything was going smoothly. The conversations were about the gifts and the current company and so there was no wedding talk. He couldn't have asked for anything easier. Until he got the text that newly engaged Stoecker and Andrea were in town from Philly and would be stopping by the exchange. The rest of the night was only wedding talk. All the girls were talking about weddings and Meg was right in there with'em, every once in a while shooting Don a stare that did not promise good things. Don, excited for the recent engagement, decided to give Stoecker a congratulations and ask him if it was cool that he was going to propose the next morning. The girls began talking about their rings and so did Don and Stoecker. Don brought up that the ring he got was rose gold to which, "Oh man that was a bold move.", was the response. Don couldn't have felt less confident. He was so nervous. The night was supposed to go way smoother and thus far had been nothing but surprises.</p>

    <p>On Meg and Don's arrival home, only hours before the proposal, both a little drunk and ready for bed. Meg turned to Don and said "Why don't you want to marry me?". Don's stomach sank to his feet. "Please go to bed and we'll discuss this in the morning.", he said to no avail. Meg had her heart set on having this conversation now, so nothing was going to stop it.</p>

    <p>Don knew planning a surprise wasn't easy. He couldn't plan a dinner and expect her not to think something was  up. He couldn't plan anything without her expecting something to be up. So his plan was to wait for HER to pick something. Meg had shown interest in seeing the Rockefeller Center Tree a few weeks back and Don had immediately know that that was where it would happen. With both of them knowing how crazy things can get there, they decided that the best time to go would be when the tree first got turned on in the morning at 5:30.</p>

    <p>As Don and Meg lay in bed Don looked over at the clock and saw that it was 1:00am. Only 4 and a half hours until they would have to get up and go. He pleaded with her to go to bed. "We're drunk and I'm not talking about this now.", he said to her. Meg was not happy with this. She decided it was best to keep up the conversation, so Don needed another idea. "If I had a ring right now and gave it to you would you be happy?". "No", she said. "Then it wouldn't be because you wanted to, but because I made you.". There was no way out, he thought. "How do I just get her to go to bed!" He looked at the clock again. 2:00am. They had been talking about this for an hour. Three and half hours of sleep was not enough. He needed her to go to bed. After months of planning and secret keeping and sneaking around, Don couldn't take it anymore. He turned to Meg and screamed "I have the ring and I'm doing it tomorrow at the tree!!!!". Meg was shocked. She didn't know what to do. She was so excited and so upset all at the same time. The conversation switched very quickly to, "I have to get my hair done. I have to get my nails done. I have to get .... zzzz". Meg finally fell asleep.</p>

    <p>The next morning was slightly awkward. Don hoped Meg was too drunk to remember what he had said, and Meg didn't think Don would actually do it now because she knew how much the surprise meant to him. They got dressed not saying much and headed to see the tree. Don wanted things to go smoothly, so he put the ring in the breast pocket of his jacket so that he would be able to get it quickly when the time came. As they got to the tree Don got down on his knee to take a picture of Meg and reached into his pocket. He grabbed the box and tried to pull it out. He struggled and moved his hand but couldn't seem to get it out. Meg all the while noticed what Don was doing and after  the last night's conversation knew exactly what's about to happen. A minute or so of struggling and Don finally got the ring out and asked Meg to marry him in the most awkward, non-smooth way that he possibly could have.</p>

    <p>The Bishroches were ready for marriage.</p>
